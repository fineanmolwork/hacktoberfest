Problem Statement
You are given 3 non-negative integers A, B and C. In one operation, you can pick any two of the given integers and subtract one from both of them.

If it is possible to make all the 3 integers zero after some number of operations (possibly none), print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".
Input
The first line contains a single integer T – the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contains 3 space separated integers A, B and C respectively.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
0 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 10
Output
Output T lines, the ith line containing a single word, either "Yes" or "No" – the answer to the ith test case.
Example
Sample Input 1:
2
3 4 2
2 2 2

Sample Output 1:
No
Yes

Sample Explanation 1:
For the first test case, there is no possible way to make all the elements zero.
For the second test case, we can pick elements in the following order: (A,B), (B,C), (A,C)
